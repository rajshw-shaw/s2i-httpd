# S2I assemble script for the 'lighttpd-centos7' image.
# The 'assemble' script builds your application source so that it is ready to run.
#
# For more information refer to the documentation:
#	https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/builder_image.md

# If the 'lighttpd-centos7' assemble script is executed with the '-h' flag, print the usage.
if [[ "$1" == "-h" ]]; then

# Important Point to be noted 
# By default the s2i build places the application source in /tmp/src directory.
# This directory is where the source and other assets will be placed for the build process. 
#You can modify this location by setting the io.openshift.s2i.destination label or 
# passing --destination flag, in which case the sources will be placed in the src subdirectory of the directory you specified. 
#The destination in the above command (./) is using working directory set in the openshift/base-centos7 image, 
#which is set to be /opt/app-root/src.
